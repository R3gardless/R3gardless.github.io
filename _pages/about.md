ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I am currently in the 6th semester at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.skku.edu/eng_cse/index.do) at [SungKyunKwan Univ](https://www.skku.edu/skku/index.do).

I am deeply interested in `DevOps`, `MLops` and `Cloud computing` and think about how to improve development efficiency.

I also like to put ideas to practical use through development to solve inconveniences in everyday life.

Currently, I am focusing on `full-stack development` using Next.js, Nest.js and `Reinforcement Learning`, `Generative Adversarial Networks` for automated cryptocurrency trading.
